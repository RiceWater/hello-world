My first step in learning git and github

It's pretty much needed for work, but it's also really useful for personal projects as well. This'll solve having tons of duplicate files in my desktop haha! Well, I have a strong feeling that this'll be useful to me one day, so here I am.

UPDATE: The project I volunteered in will be using GitHub. Boy, I sure wish I already knew how to use it! Oh, well. On a random note, I got a loss-streak on LoL, and that really ticked me off...

UPDATE 2: This should be in the other branch, then it'll be for checking
